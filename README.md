# `jj` as a replacement for `git`
This repo is an investigation in the different workflows I currently use git for and how they can be replaced with `jj`. The goal is to find out if `jj` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `git` in my daily workflow as well as to find out if there are any workflows that `jj` can improve upon. 

## TODO
- [ ] Create a repo for testing
- [ ] Make TODO for advanced Git usages
- [ ] Walk through jj equivalent for Git usages
- [ ] Explore unique jj features
